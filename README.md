# Database
## machine table
`mchine` table is a lookup table for hash_code (id) to host name.  
Table field is

| id (TEXT) | name (TEXT)| ip_address (TEXT)|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| hash_code_1 | host_1 | host_1_ip |
| hash_code_2 | host_2 | host_2_ip |
| ... | ... | ... |
| hash_code_n | host_n | host_n_ip |
  
hash_code will be generated by Python code  
```
hash_code = random.getrandbits(128)
```
  
## {host} table
Each host has own table for logging.  
Table field is  

| timestamp (TEXT) | data (BLOB)|
|-----------|------------| 
| timestamp_1 | data_1 |
| timestamp_2 | data_2 |
| ... | ... |
| timestamp_n | data_n |
  
`timestamp` is based on server time zone and the style is "YYYYMMDDhhmmss".  
`data` is a Python dict object while it is serialized and compressed by Python bz2.
